# Project Documentation

## Introduction

The `community-health-files` package is designed to automate the creation and management of essential files like `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `BUG_REPORT.yml`, and `SECURITY.md` for open-source projects.

This package is designed to offer a streamlined and efficient workflow for managing community health files, such as contributing guidelines, security policies, and codes of conduct, in a structured and easily accessible manner.

This documentation will guide you through the process of setting up, configuring, and using the project effectively. We encourage contributions from the community, whether it's through code, documentation improvements, or sharing ideas.

```

### Updating the FUNDING.yml File

If you chose to skip the funding options during the installation process, you can still add or update the funding information in the _`.github/FUNDING.yml`_ file later. Here‚Äôs how to do it:

1. Navigate to the _`.github/FUNDING.yml`_ in your project.

2. **Format your funding information**:

   - Use the following format to specify your funding sources:

   ```yaml
   github: [username1, username2]
   patreon: username
   tidelift: package/name
   custom: ["https://link1.com", "https://link2.com"]
   ```

   - Replace the placeholders with your actual funding information:
     - `github`: List your GitHub sponsors' usernames in square brackets, separated by commas.
     - `patreon`: Enter your Patreon username.
     - `tidelift`: Specify your Tidelift package.
     - `custom`: Include any additional funding links you wish to add in an array format.

3. **Example**:

   Here‚Äôs an example of how the file may look after editing:

   ```yaml
   github: [octocat, surftocat]
   patreon: octocat
   tidelift: npm/octo-package
   custom: ["https://www.paypal.me/octocat", "https://octocat.com"]
   ```

   By following these steps, you can ensure that your funding options are up to date and easily accessible to your project's supporters.
